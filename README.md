============

This project grew out of pure utility as I explored cafes to work in when I first arrived in SF. It was surprising that cafes in the city hadn't been mapped purely based on their WiFi reliability. After a couple years, the map hit the 200k view mark and I started thinking about how to make it handier.

The first goal was to make it independent of Google maps and accessible to mobile. Leaflet made that fairly simple and I have a map that geolocates to a user's location.

My next goals are:
-Add filter functionality
-Set opening and closing time filters so you can search based on your planned work window (Ex. You know you want to do a late work session and only want to see cafes that won't cut your time short by closing early).
-Extend cafe metadata for unique filters
-Add social/feedback features to crowdsource updates on cafe details.
